#### I've had an interest in computers since daycare where I would spend as much of my free time on the two available computers in the kids class. I got into programming in University and was immediately hooked. It took a while to refine what it was I wanted to do with it, but I immediately realized the near infinite potential that learning to program could unlock. I'm currently seeking employment to further my knowledge and give me direction in my coding journey! In my freetime I am working on projects in Python, but am very familiar with C# from when I was working on Game Development. 
 
##### Currently refining my DeskStop program, an app I made to help keep my computer organized. I figure I spend as much time staring at my various screens as I do staring at my room, so it only makes sense to keep all of my spaces tidy, even the virtual ones.
